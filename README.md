# About
First of all, I must say that I wrote such a project because of my interest in security and social engineering, and I will develop other versions of this project in the future. I also have no responsibility for using this (phishing method) or hacking somebody. 
for explaining the project I just say that, when a user input username and password the Telegram Bot send data to your Telegram Account.
